//Classes to implement:
// - Game Manager (Game status, (HashMap idPlayer, List<Cards>) Player cards, Table, List<Cards> Table cards)
// the manager shall follow the game progression and impose the rules.

// - Status (Actual status (Flop, ecc...), Past status(number of bets/check/fold))
// - Dealer (Init cards, Give cards, Shuffle Cards)
// - Player (Current bet, Enum -> Player status (idle, active), Utility)
// - Table (Players, HashMap(id, Player))

// To calculate the score check in first place the "combination", then if there's a tie
// Lets try to unite both the ideas.
// every combination should have a score
// then evaluate the score and in the case there's a tie
// the code should act like normal and verify the suit's score.

// Check the cards details.
